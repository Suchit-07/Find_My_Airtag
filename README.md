# Find_My_Airtag

## Description

A web app made using reactjs and a nodejs backend that allows users to view their Apple Find My data across the network on non apple products. (Full credit goes to https://github.com/DylanAkp/AirtagsAnywhere for the backend. I just fixed the frontend which wouldn't work for me.)

## Installation
1. Clone the repo
2. `npm install` in both the find_my_airtag and back_airtags 
3. `npm start` in back_airtags
4. `npm start` in find_my_airtag
